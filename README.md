# RP_Zero-Cost-BCI-Simulation
This project demonstrates a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) simulation using real EEG signals to classify binary decisions (Yes/No). It is designed as an accessible prototype for researchers and students to understand and explore cognitive signal processingâ€”without needing expensive hardware.
